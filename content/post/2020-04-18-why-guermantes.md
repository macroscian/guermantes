*Guermantes* is a place, a family name, and a leitmotif that pervades
Marcel Proust's magnificent novel *In Search of Lost Time*; faced
with chosing a name for my blog, a tribute to my favourite novel
seemed as good as any.

The third volume in the series is entitled *Le Côté de Guermantes*, a
reference back to the first volume (contrastingly titled *The Way by
Swann's*), and both derive from the two routes that the narrator
explored in his childhood. His astonishment that two such different
routes could lead to the same place, but offer such different
experiences is typical of one of the joys of the novel - how Proust
uses extended narrative themes to delve deeply into personal
experiences and make them universally applicable.

The Guermantes family are the local aristocrats that the narrator
first encounters in the guise of their estate near the childhood home
of Combray. By the third volume, this architectural icon has taken human
form in the person of Oriane, Duchesse de Guermantes. An obsession of
the narrator, and reflecting his desire to achieve the stamp of
approval of the lofty inhabitants of Faubourg St. Germain, the way her
unawareness of the narrator turns from annoyance to indifference and
finally casual acceptance portrays a sympathetic story of
self-discovery that avoids self-indulgence. 

Most posts on here won't be on this theme, but I may well dot the more
scientific/mathematical posts with more meandering thoughts on some of
my favourite cultural references. And the '.xyz' part of the site name
represents three of my favourite mathematical symbols.
